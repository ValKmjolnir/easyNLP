Do NLP without coding!

In this programme i will use dynamic arrays to complete neural networks which can do NLP tasks.

And this is a C/C++ project.

To avoid someone copying the code to just finish the classwork,i will only update some parts of the programme.After the deadline i'll update all the code.By that time you can use it to train a model without writing codes or use these header files and models to help you write your own model!

Total:8631 lines

But there still has some problems inside

The problem: DeepLSTM and DeepGRU may crash when using constructor without any logic error.Sometimes system traces back and gives you SIGTRAP or SIGSEGV and just crashes.I cannot understand why and hope some of you could help me with this problem! :) Thx!
