# easyNLP
Do NLP without coding(or you may use the headers to create your own model)!

In this programme i will use dynamic arrays to make neural networks which can do NLP tasks.

And this is a C/C++ project.

After 2019/5/11 I'll set easyNLP_main to public.

But there still has some problems inside

The problem: DeepLSTM and DeepGRU may crash when using constructor without any logic error.Sometimes system traces back and gives you SIGTRAP or SIGSEGV and just crashes.I cannot understand why and hope some of you could help me with this problem! :) Thx!
